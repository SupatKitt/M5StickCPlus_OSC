# M5StickCPlus_OSC
 
This code transmits distance data from the time of flight sensor via the OSC protocol using M5StickCPlus (ESP32).

Main interface and OSC implementation is written by Martin Parker and Joe Hathway.

The code for getting distance data is from [M5stack](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/hat/hat-tof) website 

I just put all of the code together. :)
