# M5StickCPlus_OSC
 
This is a code for transmitting distance data from time of flight sensor via OSC protocol

Main interface and OSC implementation is written by Martin Parker and Joe Hathway.

The code for getting distance data is from [M5stack](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/hat/hat-tof) website 

I just put all of the code together. :)
